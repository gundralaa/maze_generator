Map Generator
Objective:
Generate an OpenGL window environment using a predefined txt file coordinate file
noting closed off areas and open non walled areas

ex:
input as follows
(dimensions xy)
000000000000000000000
0000000********000000
0000000********000000
0000000***c****000000
0000000********000000
000000000000000000000

* = chamber
c = camera
0 = space

draw simple walls at every start and end of a **** row
	some defined height
	textured
	two triangles using element buffer
generate camera movable or place sprite movable in map

classes

camera
	control the view matrix to interact with shaders
shader
	generate shader program
	write - shaders
	easily interface
wall
	defines buffer for a single wall segment
	defines textures for single wall segment
window
	creates window
	controls input
readers
	reads input file and creates wall objects
main
	uses reader to take file
	renders the wall segements
